SHOOT ONESELF, can still sometimes SHOOT ONESELF with a bullet whilst moving!!! launch bullets a few more pixels further ahead of the nose!! // 06/10/19 increased additional margin from 1 to 3 pixels (bullet_margin property of ControlSystem) - done the job? // 08/10/19 NO! NOT RESOLVED! Not even sure if it's a bullet  that killing the ship inexplicitely, although this time definitely fired a bullet. Might be worth stick in a line of code to print a note when a bullet hits a ship, togetherw with a timestamp - to be able to confirm that this is actually the cause...if it is will then be a matter of working out why it's happening, starting to believe it's nothing to do with not being fired sufficently far from the tip of the nose...how to replicate the error? // 08/10/19 was able to replicate once by 'rotating into the bullet'... firing when stationary then moving forwards and rotating...but again, can't replicate with regularity... It's a weird one // 11/10 - happened again, shooting stationary and 
then somehow being able to accelerate and rotate into the bullet. Was on a higher level when ship has notable speed...maybe related to having sufficient speed to rotate into the bullet? Although the bullet should also be going faster?! Didn't change the 
the bullet margin which remains 3 pixels more than might be thought necessary. See if it is speed related, and if so work out what needs to happen to not collide with one's own bullet!!! 12/10/19 - I bet it's the increase in the rotation speed that's allowing a ship to rotate into a bullet that it's just fired!! // 15/10/19 - can replicate at when going faster, be that due to higher bullet discharge speed or higher rotation speed...i.e. INVESTIGATE the higher rotation speed (would suggest a mere increase 
 to the margin should solve it) // 22/10/19 - change to circular image may have solved this... note any/all further occurences.

TIMESTAMP NEXT OCCURENCE...haven't noticed since at least 04/10/19
JUMP. if that occasional JUMP continues, which wasn't there before, could be to do with changing the key_press handler to return True when done, or even having changed the pyglet debug option to False!!?? (since changed this back to True)
11/10 - got a jump. Possibly just the way it is an a PC resources issue...
22/10 - massive amount of jumping, had a browser full to twitter feeds open and another with radio playing.
23/10 - jumping heavily again with a browser full to twitter feeds open and a couple of investing.com pages, although nothing else

									TODO

27/10/19 - nn Warning Radiation high sound getting caught on exit // and other sounds!!! Issue with the VS interactive interpreter? OK when executes via the Python 3.7 interpreter installed?

set up config files for novice, played_a_bit, player_too_much, expert and NB these 
exist to the main documentation.

CODE STRUCTURE
The 'sprites' module is not limited to sprites...with the likes of Control System and RadiationMonitor classes in there. Might need a rename!! Or strip out the non-sprite classes? The latter option certainly a possible rabbit hole!! Make sure any stripping out will genuinely result in a code structure that sufficently clearer to warrant the changes.

DOCUMENTATION
To experiment with Sphinx and write up as applic, to inc reference from / to Comments and Docstrings section of Code Layout Notes box of Best Practice page
Revise documentation for distribution, make a backup before starting revisions

Explore DISTRIBUTION
At least:
	install as a local project, try both non-editable and editable versions - i.e try out installing a local project via pip...
	explore using a console_script via entry_points to define a script to 
	run the game, and indeed on Windows to create an executable which has this 
	effect.
	package it on GitHub and install to my machine
	get in on the Pi
	get all the docs as required, including to read the docs	
	create an executable version, at least for Windows.
	try to create an executable version for linux and get it running on the Pi

consider documentation, licences, existing images, 
and sounds etc... together with changing to Pyrrhoids (tanks shooting custord 
pies) but being cautious to not go down a rabbit hole...stick to what I want 
need to learn from the process and dont' lose time on anicilliaries.

would need to make sure all documentation accurate and suitable for distrubtion.

would need to make sure template config file matches the actual default values 
as define on game and sprites

how to incorp main doc, as in the doc that would appear at the command line if 
were to wish to query the command line arguments? In that doc need to note that 
takes one optional argument which is the name of any configuration file, offer 
top line instructions and point towards pyglet_asteroids.config.template.__doc__

redo the asteroid graphic

Images that are not mine, i.e. which need to change or check licencing and credit as applicable:
	firework.png   easy to change, from bullet
	mine.png   can change with a bit of willing...	
	explosion.png    hard to change, if can credit, credit
    smoke.png    hard to change, if can credit, credit

Sound that's not mine, i.e. which need to change or check licencing and credit as applicable:
    # timer part of 'mr_minelaid.wav' and 'nn_mainlaid.wav'
    # gun_shot_shortened.wav   gun_shot part
	# thrusters.wav




DO NOT NOT NOTE INCLUDE MUSIC - would require the FFMpeg dependency that I think I'll get 
away without. And anyone can just play music alongside anyway.

might it be necessary to define a new boundary treatment 'stop' and 
    apply this to the Shield class? - are shields 'killing' on the other 
    side of the screen?
    apply to ships? would it preferable to simply stop them, i.e. not change the 
    current coordinate, than to bounce them?

the name!! Pyrrhoids? Can hardly go with Asteroids? If were going with Pyrrhoids, 
could change from an asteroid to a Pie? Robots with pie faces? Lose the ship for 
a tank? Would need to change the code from 'asteroid' to whatever, and 'ship' to 
whatever...

IF WERE TO DISTRIBUTE:
tidy resources folder
change images pulled from elsewhere:
   ship
   bullet and images derived from bullet
   asteroid
 check licenses of external sounds that are being used...

'FIXED' BUGS
2 PLAYER SHIPS COLLIDE IMMEDIATELY!! 11/10/19 - believe fixed by passing 
an avoid parameter to the second Player.
DELETE DELETE DELETE IF DOESN'T REOCCUR
TIMESTAMP NEXT OCCURENCE...06/10/19 - on starting game, ships given positions 
sufficiently close together that immediately collided! 07/10/19 - and again, 
definitely a problem at the beginning
TWO SHIPS positioned simultaneously on the same position....worst worse case 
could make ships invincible for first couple of seconds...TIMESTAMP the 
next time it happens. Don't believe that this can happen at the start of the 
game, although might be possible for ships to resurrect together when they 
die by hitting each other...although in theory one will have to resurrect 
before the other (whichever is queued first), such that the one that 
resurrects second should be able to 'see' and avoid the one who resurrected 
first...? // 08/10/19 - and again, at the start of the game

PICKUP SOUND TRAPPED 
11/10/19 - believe fixed by executing --_stop_all_sound-- within 
_decease_game_sprites when game ends.
there's a SOUND bug, something getting TRAPPED ON EXIT - try and workout what 
it is. There's a commented out line to game's clearscreen method which might 
solve it. TIMESTAMP the next time it happens
Nothing from 02/10 thorugh 10/10 although something hung 10/10, not sure what
10/10 - EM supply drop audio trapped on exit!!!
